Look at Bootstrap and MaterialUI components for handling the gallery and lightbox modes rather than the CSS mess it is now

Implement the lightbox component with captions or a page title

Clean up the thumbnail gallery layout

add titles to the thumbnail hovers

have show titles for the programmatically generated pages handled by a graphql query if possible
